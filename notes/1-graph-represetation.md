# Graph Representation

## Introduction

- Why should we learn Algorithm

## What is Graph

- What is Graph
- Graph vs Tree

## Types of Graph

- Based on Cycle
- Based on Edge weight
- Based on Direction

## Example of Graph

- Google Maps
- FaceBook Friend Network

## Input of a graph

- Adjecency Matrix implementation
- Adjecency List implementation
- Edge List implementation

## Comparison of 3 graph representations

- Check if 2 node connected or not
  - Adj_matrix : O(1)
  - Adj_List : (N)
  - Edge_List :O(N)
- which nodes are connected with node1
  - Adj_matrix : O(N) -> Not Better
  - Adj_List : 0(N) -> Better
  - Edge_List :O(N) -> Not Better.
- How many nodes are connected with node1
  - Adj_matrix : O(1)
  - Adj_List : 0(N)
  - Edge_List :O(N)
- Print Connection List
  - Edge_List :O(N)
